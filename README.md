# Autocorrect
#### A word-suggestion project created by Zach Blick for Adventures in Algorithms at Menlo School in Atherton, CA

This is an autorrecting program that can help you correct spelling mistakes! All user interaction is done through the terminal. You will be prompted to enter a word, and the script will offer the four closesest words if you have a spelling mistake. You then have the option to accept one of these results, or refuse the change and continue entering more words. Enjoy!

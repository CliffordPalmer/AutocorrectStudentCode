| April 5  |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| March 12 |  2:30-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                          Project launched. We spent the second half of class contemplating ways to approach the problem dynamically. It reminded me of one of the optional practice problems for our dynamic programming quiz, where the data structure is a 2D array where the row and column represent the two words. |
| March 17 | 11:25-11:55pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Started actually coding (was sick last class). Worked on just making a good edit distance function which passes the checks. Getting a lot of weird bugs which are hard to explain. |
| March 20 |  8:45-9:55pm  |                                                                                                                                           Figured out the source of all my bugs. Liam mentioned that he was adding a space to the beginning of the words he inputs to the edit distance function. This works similarly to how we initialized the first row and column to be zeros in our previous dynamic programming problem sets, to essentially provide a quick and easy "base case" |
| March 21 |  2:00-3:00pm  |                                                                                                   My edit distance function passes the checks! It's pretty fast too. I missed the class where students were brainstorming ways to pare down the dictionary to candidates. About halfway through class I asked Cody if he had any ideas, and he mentioned tokenization. I spent the rest of class thinking through how to implement it, as well as beginning work on taking user inputs. |
| March 24 |  9:00-9:30pm  |                                                                                                                             Continued with making the basic UI. took a decent amount of time, then started writing tokenization technique for paring down dictionary. I'm using 2D arrays to store the tokens for each word, but I think I need to find a better solution. The dictionary has over 140000 words, which would take a lot of space if I had a separate 2D array for each. |
| March 24 | 9:30-10:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I found my solution to the space problem: HashSets. I forgot about these. Because of the O(1) lookup times, hashsets are literally perfect. I started by finding and storing all the tokens of the dictionary words with an array of HashSets. |
| March 24 | 10:30-11:30pm | Also implemented tokens for the typed word, and switched from just searching each word in the dictionary for edit distance to using the tokens to find candidates. I didn't like the order of the results I was getting, as I was often getting long words that technically were alphabetically prioritized, so I added a case for the comparator which sorts by the difference in word lengths before alphabetically. This gave me results which felt more typical for an autocorrect. |
| March 24 | 11:30-12:00am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Spent this half hour writing up the text file going over time complexity. It's linked in the Github. |
| March 25 |  10-10:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cleaned up the UI, added a way for the user to select which word they meant. Now going back and commenting code.  |
